This is a very simple and quick script i wrote as a proof of concept for work. I realise there are probably better alternatives out there but it was my first code that i wrote to execute a specific task in mind and i feel it works quite well for what it is and wanted to have access to it in the future.

May update it with more functionality somewhere down the line
